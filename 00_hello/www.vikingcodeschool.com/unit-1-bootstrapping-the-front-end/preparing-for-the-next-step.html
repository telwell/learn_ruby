        <h2>Preparing NOW for your Next Steps</h2>

<p>Regardless of whether your goal after this program is to get a job or build a startup, there are some things you should get started doing right away to increase your odds of success.  We&#39;ll take a minute here before diving into the formal curriculum to go over some of these things.</p>

<p>Most of the energy you spend over the next several months will be (justifiably) learning how to become an effective developer because that&#39;s the most important factor in determining your future success.  But that doesn&#39;t mean there aren&#39;t other important things you should pay attention to along the way in order to increase your chances of achieving your after-program goals.</p>

<p>What we&#39;ll cover here is how to leverage your newfound skills by making yourself marketable.  This will be dealt with in greater depth towards the conclusion of the program but it&#39;s important to get started on a few things now and to let others marinate in the back of your mind.  </p>

<p>Essentially, the core of personal marketability is thinking about how to present your story and then working to make that a reality through your web presence and in interactions with other people.  </p>

<p>In this lesson, we&#39;ll cover how to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Craft your personal narrative</li>
<li>Develop and manage your web presence</li>
<li>Get out in the community</li>
<li>Build your portfolio</li>
</ol>

<p>We&#39;ll finish by providing specific recommendations for things you can do during the remainder of the program to better position yourself to achieve your goals after it finishes.</p>

<h3>Craft Your Personal Narrative</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>The first step in getting others to understand your career transition is being able to explain it to them in a compelling fashion. If you can connect the dots between your past, present, and future; identify the underlying themes in your career trajectory; and explain the unique value you can bring to your new endeavor, you’re on your way to winning their support.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>-- <a href="http://dorieclark.com/how-to-explain-your-career-transition/">How to Explain Your Career Transition</a></em></p>

<p>When you meet someone new, they typically ask you questions about who you are and where you came from.  How you respond to those types of questions helps them figure out your <em>personal narrative</em>.  This happens whether you think about it or not -- it&#39;s just the way people operate. </p>

<p>What story do you want them to hear?  </p>

<p>This narrative is what people actually remember an hour or a day or a week later.  They don&#39;t remember facts about what school you went to or how old you were when you left home but they do remember the arc of a highly motivated and talented individual who tackled successively more difficult milestones along the way to their current position. </p>

<p>This may sound like a bunch of soft nonsense but when you&#39;re having conversations with professional implications (like when you&#39;re talking to other developers or employers), having a clear narrative will help you to stand out and be memorable.  You usually only get two or three sentences to leave an impression.</p>

<p>The idea of a narrative also extends beyond just when you&#39;re meeting people face-to-face -- whenever someone Googles you, reads your Tweets, or hears other people talk about you, they&#39;re going to build a mental model for who you are based on that information.  If your narrative is inconsistent or boring, you&#39;ve wasted an opportunity.</p>

<p>So how do you build a good personal narrative?</p>

<p><em>Everyone can tell a story.</em>  </p>

<p>Lay out the facts about where you&#39;ve been, what you&#39;ve done, and what you&#39;ve learned.  What aspects of those facts can be stitched together with a compelling story?  What strong themes have been present throughout? And, most importantly, how does the trajectory of your story make you valuable to a potential employer/partner/employee/investor?</p>

<p>Build those things into your story and take ownership of it.  Now you should have a much better answer for the question &quot;How did you get into web development?&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Libby Wagner, a poet and tenured community college professor, felt apprehensive sharing her background when she first transitioned into her new career as a management consultant. “I didn’t want anyone to know I was a poet,” she says. “I had a lot of tapes going in my head.</p>

<p>The economists I had worked with had really talked down to me, and people in business certainly weren’t interested in what I did.” But she eventually came to realize her history wasn’t a liability, but a unique strength in her business. “The way I see the world is very language-driven,” she says. “I’m going to be listening for nuances and connections and patterns. That’s the way I look at the world and I take that to any interaction with the client, so I’ve learned to ask really good questions.” </p>

<p>Today, Libby has consulted for Fortune 500 clients including Boeing and Nike — and she’s christened her monthly e-newsletter, The Boardroom Poet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>-- ibid</em></p>

<h3>Develop and Manage Your Web Presence</h3>

<p>As we said above, your narrative isn&#39;t just active, it&#39;s the passive impression you leave through your digital presence as well.</p>

<p>Google yourself in an incognito window (to avoid Google&#39;s smart algorithm).  What comes up? Do the links fit into your personal narrative?  Whoever is looking to hire you will certainly Google you.  Make sure that what they find matches what you want them to find.  </p>

<p>You don&#39;t need to run out and start Tweeting if that&#39;s completely counter to your personality but you should think about strategically expanding your web presence and making yourself discoverable.  Be a modern human -- have some way for random people to contact you on the internet.  Frankly, it&#39;s strange for someone to be a web developer but not exist on the web.  </p>

<p>The best ways to manage your web presence are those which let you completely control your message.  That way, when someone stumbles upon your profiles, the first thing they see displays your narrative.  The best options are:</p>

<ul>
<li>A personal website (ideally more than just a single landing page)</li>
<li>A blog, for instance <a href="http://tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a></li>
<li>A <a href="http://medium.com/">Medium</a> profile or any other site where you can publish articles</li>
</ul>

<p>Other popular ways to boost your presence include:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <a href="http://linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> profile</li>
<li>A <a href="http://facebook.com/">Facebook</a> profile</li>
<li>A <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> account (people will often read your last ~25 tweets when researching you)</li>
<li>A <a href="http://quora.com/">Quora</a> profile where you have answered or asked some interesting questions</li>
<li>A <a href="http://meetup.com/">Meetup.com</a> profile where you&#39;ve joined interesting local groups (ideally including some tech stuff)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>As a developer, your most important online persona (aside from maybe a personal website and/or blog) is your <a href="http://github.com/">Github</a> profile</strong>.  </p>

<p>Github is how employers and developers will see which projects you&#39;ve created and how often you&#39;ve made open source contributions.  Keep that in mind as you start building projects -- make sure your Github projects have descriptive README files that explain what they are and links to their deployed form so other people can discover your awesome work.  Don&#39;t be shy about your early work either; it can form the base of a compelling growth curve.</p>

<p>The point here is to make yourself discoverable and to try and have some control over how other people will perceive you online. <strong>Start building these sites and profiles now!</strong> You shouldn&#39;t wait until you&#39;re trying to get hired or shopping your idea around to start doing this.  An online presence takes time to build.</p>

<h3>Get Out in the Community</h3>

<p>We&#39;ve talked about crafting your narrative and your online presence... but don&#39;t forget to actually get out and meet other people!  Your network of people DOES matter in a BIG way.  Most jobs out in Silicon Valley are acquired through friends of friends or former co-workers and NOT through blind resume drops.  That&#39;s at least as true elsewhere.  </p>

<p>Meeting people is best to do in person 1-on-1, where you can ask your dumb questions with a smile, but there are plenty of online communities as well (e.g. Meetup, Stack Overflow, Quora, local user groups...).  Be a part of these communities and don&#39;t be afraid to ask questions because it&#39;s a great way to build relationships.  </p>

<p><em>You&#39;re all very talented people (which is why you&#39;ve been admitted), so think of it as an odds game -- the more people you get exposed to, the more likely that someone will recognize your awesomeness and make good things happen!</em></p>

<p>Again, don&#39;t wait until the program is over to start thinking about the next steps.  If you live near or in a tech hub, reach out to developers and buy lunches and coffees.  Go to Meetups.  Set a goal of talking to 5 real human beings about your job search.  We&#39;ll give you a chance to speak with professional developers during this program but, to be truly successful, you will need to build a network of your own as well.</p>

<h3>Build Your Portfolio</h3>

<p>Your portfolio of work is the strongest asset you have, especially as a new developer.  It is crucial for demonstrating your technical skill and getting hired.  Employers want to see that you can build and ship code and that you make good decisions when confronted with engineering trade-offs. Partners/employees/investors want to see evidence of your capability as well.  They&#39;ll learn this via conversations about your portfolio of work.</p>

<p>Luckily, this is one thing that we&#39;ll do plenty of during the VCS program.  By the time you finish, you&#39;ll have built a number of interesting projects and have the skills to keep creating awesome stuff.  </p>

<h3>What We Recommend</h3>

<p>To tie everything above together, we recommend you take the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Sit down and figure out your personal narrative.</strong>  That&#39;s sort of the root of everything.</li>
<li><strong>Start blogging weekly</strong> to build your passive profile.  A great start is to sign up for <a href="http://tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> and write a post at the end of every week talking about what you learned and what you built. </li>
<li><strong>Ask or answer a question on <a href="http://www.quora.com/">Quora</a> every evening.</strong>  You&#39;re already well qualified to ask good questions and within a week you&#39;ll know more than most people on the web about development. Share your knowledge and build an active web presence by asking and answering questions on Quora.  <em>Warning: this can get addictive...</em></li>
<li><strong>Try to attend a local Meetup or chat with a local developer each week.</strong>  Just getting out of your chair and talking to real humans will be helpful for you to practice your narrative, clarify your goals, and figure out what the heck you actually want to do with your life!</li>
</ol>

<h3>Wrapping Up</h3>

<p>You should now have some idea of what you can do to kick start your next steps.  Set aside a bit of time for this stuff each week so you don&#39;t need to start from zero once you&#39;ve finished the program.  You&#39;ll be glad you did.</p>

<p>Now that we&#39;ve got that taken care of, take a deep breath and get started on this unit&#39;s lessons...</p>
